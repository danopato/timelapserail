A Time Lapse Rail
=================
This project was inspired by David Hunt's excellent documentation of a hardware store timelapse rail project:  http://www.davidhunt.ie/motorised-time-lapse-rail-with-raspberry-pi/

The goal is to use easily sourced hardware store components and 3d printed parts for the complicated joinery.

The BOM is still preliminary, so it may not have everything needed and is a bit vague about certain components.
